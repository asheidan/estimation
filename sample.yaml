- A main task:
    description:
      A string (perhaps multiline) that describes this task. This text should
      probably be formatted for readability in the file since the script will
      enforce line length anyway.
    estimate: 16d 5h
    notes:
      - Notes can also be really long or span
        multiple lines. Do whatever feels best.
      - Beware though that filtering the file through the script might reformat your
        comments, descriptions and notes
    comments:
      - This is the first comment or question that perhaps need some explanation
    tasks:
      - A subtask of the main task
      - Tasks don't have to be totally "fleshed out" to be considered tasks
- Another task:
  - Sub task that isn't really interesting
  - Sub task that have several more subsub tasks:
    - Subsubtask
    - Another subsub task
- Task with interesting subtasks:
    estimate:
    tasks:
      - Task A:
          description:
            The stakes needs to be properly marinated, but not so much as to make
            them runny.
          estimate: 15m +(5m)
          notes:
            - This a really important task to the main stake-holder
          comments:
            - The newly invented marinade eliminates the risk of marinade running amook and
              getting on the clothes
      - Task B:
          description:
            This is something strange that we really dont now much about yet
          estimate: 100d 30m ~(10m 5s)
